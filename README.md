# DS 101: Python Data Science Lessons

A comprehensive series of hands-on lessons that teach students how to scrape, wrangle, analyze, and visualize data from Reddit using Python. This package provides a complete data science workflow from data collection to advanced analysis techniques including geospatial analysis and sentiment analysis.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing these lessons, students will learn to:
- Scrape data from social media platforms (Reddit) using APIs
- Clean and wrangle messy real-world data using pandas
- Extract geographic information from text using NLP techniques
- Perform sentiment analysis using both rule-based (VADER) and transformer-based (RoBERTa) models
- Create interactive visualizations and maps using plotly
- Handle large datasets and machine learning model deployment challenges

## ⚡ Quick Start: Cloud Environment (Recommended)

**🎯 Easiest Option for Students:**

**Or follow these steps:**
1. Fork this repository
2. Go to Code → Codespaces → Create codespace on main
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for the environment to build
4. Open the terminal and run: `bash start_jupyter.sh`

📖 See [CODESPACES_QUICKSTART.md](CODESPACES_QUICKSTART.md) for detailed instructions.

- Analyze sentiment of location-containing text
- Visualize sentiment patterns across geographic regions
- Evaluate model performance and limitations
- Create correlation analyses between sentiment and engagement metrics

## 🚀 Quick Start with Automated Setup

This repository includes an automated setup system that creates a complete Python virtual environment with all required dependencies.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Windows, macOS, or Linux
- Internet connection (for downloading packages and ML models)

### One-Command Setup
```bash
python manual_setup.py
```

### What `manual_setup.py` Does
The automated setup script provides a **bulletproof installation process** that:

1. **Creates Isolated Environment**: Builds a dedicated virtual environment (`ds101_manual`) to prevent package conflicts
2. **Installs All Dependencies**: Automatically installs 20+ required packages including:
   - Data manipulation: `pandas`, `numpy`
   - Web scraping: `praw` (Reddit API)
   - NLP & Sentiment: `nltk`, `transformers`, `torch`, `spacy`
   - Geospatial: `geopandas`, `geopy`
   - Visualization: `plotly`, `matplotlib`
   - Jupyter ecosystem: `jupyter`, `ipykernel`

3. **Pre-downloads ML Models**: Downloads and caches large models (like RoBERTa ~500MB) to prevent classroom delays
4. **Configures Jupyter Integration**: Registers the environment as a Jupyter kernel for seamless notebook execution
5. **Validates Installation**: Runs comprehensive tests to ensure everything works correctly

### Why This Setup Prevents Hiccups

**🛡️ Isolation**: Virtual environment prevents conflicts with existing Python installations
**📦 Version Control**: Locks specific package versions that are known to work together
**🤖 Model Pre-caching**: Downloads transformer models ahead of time (prevents 15+ minute delays during class)
**🧪 Validation**: Tests all components before students start lessons
**🔄 Reproducibility**: Ensures identical environments across all student machines


## 🔧 Technical Requirements

### Minimum System Requirements
- **RAM**: 4GB (8GB recommended for transformer models)
- **Storage**: 2GB free space (includes ML models)
- **Python**: 3.8-3.11 (3.12+ may have package compatibility issues)

### Key Dependencies
- **Core**: pandas, numpy, jupyter
- **API Access**: praw (Reddit), requests
- **NLP**: nltk, spacy, transformers, torch
- **Geospatial**: geopandas, geopy, folium
- **Visualization**: plotly, matplotlib, seaborn
- **ML**: scikit-learn, scipy
